# Search-Agents
- Using Berkleyâ€™s Pac-Man simulator, various artificial intelligence techniques were implemented to automate the video game Pac-Man effieciently.
- Implemented artificial intelligence search methods including depth first search, breadth first search, a-star search, and uniform cost search, to enable Pac-Man to optimally consume all of the dots in the plane.
- Designed and implemented Q-learning and Value iteration reinforcement learning techniques to find the best policy for the model
